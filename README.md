# SOLERT Alerts System

This is a Solana based Web3 dApp, developed by Lalit A Patel, for the Colosseum Solana Radar Global Hackathon 2024.

# Why

- When disasters strike, people and economies may sink.
- Disasters can occur by way of errors in a software, distressed people in a community, leaking pipes on a ground, tax violations by a retailer, or rocks falling from the sky.
- Timely and reliable alerts can reduce chances of disasters.
-  There exist several web2 based alerts platforms.
- Web3 in general and Solana in particular can play an important role in devising alters systems.
- An agency attending to certain types of incidents will have a web3 webpage.
- Users can go to a relevant webpage, and report incidents they have noted.
- The agency can track this webpage, and take necessary actions.
