# SOLERT Alerts System

This is a Solana based Web3 dApp, developed by Lalit A Patel, for the Colosseum Solana Radar Global Hackathon 2024.

# Why

- When disasters strike, people and economies may sink. Disasters can occur by way of errors in a software, distressed people in a community, leaking pipes on a ground, tax violations by a retailer, or rocks falling from the sky. Timely and reliable alerts can reduce chances of disasters.
- There exist several Web2 based alerts platforms. In such a platform, an agency attending to certain types of incidents has a web webpage. Users go to a relevant webpage, and report incidents they have noted. The agency tracks this webpage, and takes necessary actions. Web3 in general and Solana in particular can play an important role in devising alerts systems.
- For the Colosseum Solana Radar Global Hackathon 2024, Lalit A Patel has built a Solana based Web3 dApp, called Solent Alerts System. He has hosted it on his local computer, and ported it to his domain name, taxai dot us.

# To Do for Admin

- Confirm the validity of the necessary API keys.
- In a command line terminal, go to this project's app folder.
- Run 'npm run dev' or 'sudo npm run dev' command. 

# To Do for User

- In Google Chrome, go to taxai.us. (Please message me if this server is down when you visit.) This Solert webpage shows journal in the top and map in the bottom.
- From Google Chrome Extensions, open Solflare or Phantom Wallet Extension. The wallet should be set for your own account. Point it to Solana Devnet network. If the wallet has no SOL amount, add some SOL by Airdrop. On the webpage, click Select Wallet. Select Solflare Wallet. Connect the Wallet.
- If asked by the webpage, create a new Alerts journal. Approve it in the wallet. Webpage will now show the created journal. The alert dialog box on the webpage requires latitude, longitude, and description of the incident you want to report. (Later versions of this tool will require address instead of latitude and longitude.)
- Write 44 -100 Water leaking a lot. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 44 -100.
- Write 38 -90 Someone yelling loudly. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 38 -90.
- Write 41 -110 Boat sinking. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 41 -110. Zoom the map if you need.
- Write Software not working. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, but the map will not add any marker, since the entry did not mention location.
- Write 44 -105 Heart attack. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 44 -105.
